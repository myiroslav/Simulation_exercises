# Simulation_exercises
This repository is meant for me to share my code/solutions concerning exercices of simulation appleid to finance. 
It will usually a python notebook. If possible I'll directly post the subject in english. If I don't have it, 
the questions are translated directly in the notebook, so it is clear to everyone what I am doing. 
Usually there are a few math question, and then an implementation in python, and then some plots. 
If you have any questions, suggestions, feel free to reach out to me.
